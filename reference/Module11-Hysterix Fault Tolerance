EmployeePayroll  |  Employee  | Role

Say Employee is down ?

We can provide a default way of handling such exceptions

HYSTERIX will help create a fault tolerant application.


1. Add dependency for Hysterix:
   o.s.c
   spring-cloud-starter-hysterix
   
2. In the Controller enable annotation
   @EnableHystrix
   @RestController
   
3. How to define what needs to be done during exception scenarios

  a) Try to create a scenario for Runtime Exception

  @HysterixCommand(fallbackMethod="fallBackEmployeeDetails")
  @GetMapping("/employee/fault-tolerance")
  public Employee getDetails()
   {
      throw new RuntimeException("Check Hysterix behaviour");
     }
     
   b) create the fallback method defined and link with the annotation as above
     public Employee fallBackEmployeeDetails()
      {
        return new Employee("firstname",.....);
        
     
     
     
   public Employee
